# How [Jiggle](https://github.com/annazeit/bevy_blog_code/blob/main/jiggle/src/main.rs) works

The jiggle effect on the sphere is achieved through procedural animation, triggered by pressing **B** or clicking on the sphere. Here's how it works:

### **1. Activating the Jiggle**
- When **B** is pressed or the sphere is clicked, the `JiggleAnimation` component is activated (`active = true`), and a timer starts (`timer = 0.0`).
- The sphere will jiggle for **1.5 seconds**, as defined by `JIGGLE_DURATION`.

### **2. Calculating the Jiggle Motion**
- The animation follows a **sinusoidal movement**:
  - A **jiggle amplitude** (`1.0`) defines how far the sphere moves up and down.
  - A **jiggle speed** (`16.0`) controls how fast the movement oscillates.
  - The amplitude **decays over time**, meaning the jiggle starts strong and fades out.

### **3. Applying the Jiggle to the Sphere**
- Every frame, the vertical position (`transform.translation.y`) is updated using:
  \[
  \text{offset} = \sin(\text{timer} \times \text{jiggle speed}) \times \text{amplitude}
  \]
- The **amplitude decays quadratically** over time:
  \[
  \text{amplitude} = (\frac{\text{JIGGLE_DURATION} - \text{timer}}{\text{JIGGLE_DURATION}})^2
  \]
- When the timer reaches `JIGGLE_DURATION`, the jiggle stops and the sphere resets to its default position.

### **4. Jiggle on Click**
- A **raycast** is used to determine if the mouse clicked on the sphere.
- If the ray intersects with the sphere's **bounding radius**, the jiggle animation is triggered.

This results in a natural **bouncy movement** that quickly oscillates and then fades out smoothly. If you want a more exaggerated or prolonged effect, adjusting **amplitude, speed, or decay rate** can fine-tune the jiggle behavior. Let me know if you need tweaks! ðŸš€
